## Abstract

Join us for this full-day, hands-on workshop where you will learn how to utilize the provided tools and implement various messaging patterns in the cloud, providing robust implementations for your microservices. You will leave ready to take on the world.

If you are a developer or architect who wants to take your cloud-based applications to the next level, this feature-packed workshop is designed for you! Interactive, hands-on labs will draw you deep into the fundamentals of messaging patterns such as Publish-Subscribe, Message Queues, and Request-Reply. By discussing the core concepts and frameworks across the main cloud providers (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud), you walk out with tons of knowledge!

In this highly interactive session, you’ll learn how to:

* Create and manage messaging services in the cloud using hands-on labs.
* Use practical, real-world examples and implement messaging patterns by implementing key messaging patterns to improve application reliability and scalability.
* Guided, hands-on activities to implement best practices and troubleshoot common issues.

When you leave this session, you’ll understand how to use messaging patterns to build resilient cloud applications, primed to build for the challenges you face in your cloud architecture.

## Key Learning Goals

- Understand Core Messaging Patterns: Gain a solid understanding of fundamental messaging patterns such as Publish-Subscribe, Message Queues, and Request-Reply, and their importance in cloud architecture.
- Hands-On Implementation: Develop practical skills by setting up and configuring messaging services in the cloud, and implementing these patterns through interactive, hands-on labs.
- Apply Best Practices: Learn best practices for implementing messaging patterns, troubleshoot common issues, and ensure your applications are resilient and scalable across different cloud platforms.
